## What can my Photoshop do?
First of all my photoshop can carry out the work of basic filters such as: grayscale, contrast enhancement, bluer, image cropping, negative conversion. But the trick of my Photoshop was my own filter: the filter "film camera effect", which makes the image the way it would be if it were obtained by photographing with a film camera.
